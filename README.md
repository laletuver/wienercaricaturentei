# Transcribing Viennese Caricatures from "Wiener Caricaturen" Magazine (1897 Edition)
# Overview
This project was developed as part of the "Analyzing Central Europe's Intellectual Heritage" course at the University of Vienna. Its aim was to transcribe the first pages of the 1897 editions of the "Wiener Cariccaturen" newspaper. 
The editions are publicly accessible via the ANNO website at this [link](https://anno.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno?aid=wcc&datum=1897&zoom=33). 

The transcription process involved encoding the first pages using the Oxygen XML Editor, following the TEI XML guidelines.

# Transcription Content

Each page includes the following structural metadata:
- Newspapers name
- Publication date
- Issue number
- Cost

These details were available on each first page of the 1897 editions.

For text pattern identification, the following types of distinct patterns in text content integrated with illustrations were identified:

- figure type = "narration" : Designed specifically for illustrations with no dialogues and a general narrative text. 
- figure type = "dialogue" : Designed specifically for dialogues between people.
- figure type = "monologue" : Designed for monologues.
- figure type = "poem" : Designed for poems.

Each figure is described by a figDesc for better understanding of the text, and URLs are attached for reference.

Additionally, listPerson and listPlace were used for detailed representation of characters and places.
